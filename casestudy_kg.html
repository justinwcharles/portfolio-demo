                    <h3>Brief</h3>
                    <p>Our mission for this project was to find a local client who was in need of an online shop to sell items for their business.  We wanted to focus on <strong>responsive web design</strong> with a <strong>mobile-first</strong> approach.</p>
                    <p>Our client was Kelli Golden-Powell of KG Creates.  Kelli crafts and sells beautiful earrings with unique designs made of clay and brass.</p>

                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <p>Shoppers love the convenience of shopping online and supporting local businesses.  However, they struggle to make purchases without being able to experience the weight, texture and quality of jewelry.</p>
                    <p>How might we reduce the risk of buying products online to allow shoppers to feel confident in making online purchases?</p>

                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p>Inspire confidence in shoppers with quality product images, reviews, and advertising KG’s pop-up shops to invite customers to shop in person.  Keep visitors engaged with a straightforward navigating experience, a simple checkout flow, and details about how the product is made and where materials are sourced from.</p>

                <div class="col s12 m8 l8">    
                    <p>We began with a kickoff meeting with the client to understand more about her product, preferences,
                        and branding. A <strong>survey</strong> was conducted which garnered responses from 53 women between
                        16-35 years old. We then conducted 6 <strong>semi-structured interviews</strong> with women between
                        the ages of 23-34 who regularly wear jewelry and shop online.</p>
                    <h3>From this research, we gained some key insights:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Although 85% of survey respondents value <strong>quality</strong> most, they struggle to
                            perceive the quality of items when shopping online</li>
                        <li>People feel <strong>engaged with a brand</strong> when they understand the “why” and “how”
                            behind product creation</li>
                        <li>A swift, secure <strong>checkout experience</strong> with diverse payment options and stored
                            information is critical</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>After becoming familiar with the user, we defined the key features. First, we used our research to
                        define a list of features. Then, we plotted them on a <strong>feature prioritization matrix</strong>
                        to understand what we should tackle first to be able to deliver a minimum viable product.</p>

                    <p>Then, we created a <strong>sitemap</strong> to plan the <strong>information architecture</strong> for
                        the site. Our approach was to keep the amount of pages to a minimum so we did not distract the user
                        from the primary purpose of the site: to make a purchase.</p>

                    <p>We then created some <strong>wireframes</strong> and began <strong>user testing</strong>, focusing on the shop and checkout flow since this was the primary purpose of the site.  We focused our testing on mobile since we believe the majority of users will be experiencing the shop from this size device.</p>
                    <h3>Our test plan was simple: ask users to purchase a pair earrings.</h3>
                    <p>This required users to land on the home page, navigate to the shop and then to the product page, add earrings to their cart, and go through the checkout flow.</p>
                    <p>Going from home to cart yielded flawless execution from all users we tested with.</p>

                    <h3>The checkout flow is where we learned some key insights</h3>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Even though there was a progress tracker, navigating back and forth through the flow was confusing</li>

                    <p>To alleviate all of these concerns, we decided to move to a 1 page checkout experience.</p>

                <p>With our lo-fi design and testing complete, it was time to define the visual style and move into hi-fi.  Based on our kickoff meeting with the client, we knew we wanted the site to have a tone that was:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>personable,</li>
                    <li>warm,</li>

                <p>The client was inspired by a desert sunset theme which was also reflected in her earring designs.  With these principles in mind we created a <strong>mood board</strong> she was very happy with.</p>
