                    <h3>Brief</h3>
                    <p>Inspired by recent innovations in augmented and mixed reality, our goal for this project was to
                        create an app that utilizes visual inputs to deliver a solution to the user based on what they
                        see.</p>
                    <p>Veritune is an app that uses AR technology to "see" your surroundings and plays music that fits
                        the scene.</p>

                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <p>There is a strong relationship between the environment and the music people listen to, but
                        finding the right song to match the moment can be challenging.</p>
                    <p>How might we create a solution that delivers the right tune at the right time?</p>

                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p>Use multiple inputs such as a view of the user's surroundings, weather, mood, and heartbeat to
                        play the perfect songs. We designed a no-nonsense experience that relieves the user of having to
                        search for and select music with an interface that pushes everything out of users' line of sight
                        so they can carry on with their day while leaving the app open.</p>
                    <p>Additional to designing for AR devices, we also designed a mobile app to ensure we reached a
                        large audience.</p>

                </div>

                <div class="col s12 m1 l1"></div>

                <div class="col s12 m8 l8">
                    <p>We began with a <strong>survey</strong> where we heard from 65 music enthusiasts between
                        18-35 years old. We then conducted 5 <strong>semi-structured interviews</strong> with men and
                        women between
                        the ages of 24-33 who listen to music daily.</p>
                    <h3>From this research, we gained some key insights:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>43% would use this app on mobile, 15% would use an AR wearable, and 34% would use both. This
                            informed our decision to design for both <strong>mobile</strong> and an <strong>AR
                                wearable</strong>.</li>
                        <li>97% say music impacts your feelings towards the environment, and 83% say location impacts
                            the music you listen to. This tells us <strong>there is a strong relationship between your
                                surroundings and the music you listen to.</strong></li>
                        <li>People struggle to find songs that satisfy them in the moment, and are often not in the mood
                            to spend time looking at a device scrolling through endless playlists. This influenced us to
                            forego a playlist approach and instead go with an app that <strong>plays music
                                automatically</strong> based on multiple inputs.</li>
                        <li>It would be cool to see where friends are and what they are listening to, so we included a
                            <strong>friends</strong> feature.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Once we had a stronger understanding of our user, we made a list of potential features for the
                        app. Then we plotted them on a <strong>feature prioritization matrix</strong> to gain clarity on
                        what would have the biggest impact and would be the least complex to implement for a minimum
                        viable product.</p>

                    <p>With the main direction and core features of the app defined, we created a

                        that the sign up/onboarding flow and the home screen with the core features of the app should be
                        our primary focus.

                            because we wanted to ensure we could include all the features we were aiming for with

                        <h3>Research on design patterns for AR wearable devices informed our decision to create separate
                            style guides in some areas for mobile and AR wearables</h3>
                        <p>One difference was typography. For AR wearables, text is more legible for the user with
                            <strong>heavier font weights</strong>.

                        <p>Another difference between mobile and AR wearables is the size of <strong>touch
                                targets</strong>. We used 44 pts as the standard for mobile and 60 pts as the standard
                            for AR wearables. Icons are text were also scaled appropriately.</p>

                        <p>The biggest difference was the <strong>grid system</strong>. When it comes to AR wearables,
                            there is a sweet spot where it is most comfortable for users to move their eyes and head to
                            view content. It is advisable to design horizontally rather than vertically, but with a
                            limit on how far to the left and right you should go. This was very important for our design
                            since our goal was to push the UI away from the center as far as possible.</p>
                        <p>For mobile, we made sure to leave space at the top and bottom for the mobile operating system
                            UI.</p>

                            Group members were assigned different parts of the site to work on, and then I reviewed and
                            updated each frame to ensure a consistent look and feel through the app.</p>

                        <p>As we moved to hi-fi, we made the decision to forego a menu-style navigation, and instead
                            allow the user to swipe left and right to navigate to other parts of the app. A settings
                            button was placed where the menu was previously.</p>
                        <p>Users were not clear on how to use and navigate the app, so we added a tutorial after the
                            onboarding flow.</p>

                        <p>We were pleased to use a video I captured at a local coffee shop to simulate what a user
                            would see if they were wearing a mixed reality headset or using their mobile device's
                            camera. From the home screen, I love how the left and right swiping animation looks on top of the looping

                            research and testing throughout the project</h3>
                        <p>We were able to start in a clear direction and
                            then learn critical feedback along the way before we invested too much time in hi-fi design.
                            Additionally, researching about design guidelines for recent AR wearable technology was
                            interesting and played a big part in how we designed the style guide.</p>


                        <h3>Given the time constraints we were working under, we quickly moved into hi-fi design
                            before the style guide was completed</h3>
                        <p>This caused some rework at the end to ensure a
                            consistent look and feel across the app. My biggest takeaway from this project was to ensure
                            a robust style guide is in place and to communicate clearly across the team about how to use
                            it before moving to hi-fi design.</p>
                        <p>This was such a fun project to work on!  We worked well as a team and learned a lot along the way.</p>
